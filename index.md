## SOP (Standard Operating Procedures)
These are the procedures that are followed by all Instructors that will ensure the safety of all participants.

## EAP (Emergency Action Plan)
This is a functional document that defines what to do in case of an emergency, and also the relevant information, that will help you in these situations.

Recent updates to the EAP's are the use of ["What 3 Words"](https://what3words.com) location indicators.
